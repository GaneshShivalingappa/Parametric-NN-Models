# Introduction

In this project, WE conducted a comparative analysis between the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) and the Finite Element Method enhanced neural network (FEM-NN), along with a FEM data-based model in the context of material parameter identification. These models can be surrogate models for material parameter identification by solving inverse problems. For this study, I considered a 1D bar fixed at one end and applied traction at the free end. Within this framework, I systematically evaluated and compared the performance of PINN, FEM-NN, and the FEM data-based model. The results were benchmarked against the analytical solution, and I conducted a comprehensive training time analysis to provide insight into the computational efficiency of these methods.
